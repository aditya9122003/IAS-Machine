# IAS-Machine
Computer Architecture Assignment-1

In the following assignment, my main aim was to calculate the nth term of fibonacci sequence.

The registers involved in IAS computer are:
AC  : Accumulator: Accumulate/hold results of an ALU operation

IR  : Instructions Register: 8 bit opcode of the instruction to be executed
	
MQ  : Multiplier/Quotioent Register: LSB of product

IBR : Instructions Buffer register: Holds the RHS instruction temporarily

MBR : Memory Buffer register: Contains a word to be read/stored in memory or I/O

MAR : Memory Adress register: Specifies the address in memory of the word to be written/read into MBR

PC  : Program Counter: Holds the next instructionâ€™s address

Running of Program consisits of two cycles:
i) Fetch cycle:
	 Opcode of the next instruction is loaded into the IR and the address portion is loaded into the MAR. 
	 In this phase the Program Counter(PC) value is moved to the Memory Address Register(MAR) and the value at the memory location MAR is fed into the Memory Buffer Register(MBR).
         Once this is done, the OPCODE of the LEFT instruction is loaded into the Instruction Register(IR)and the address portion is loaded into the MAR and the right instruction is loaded into the Instruction Buffer Register(IBR).

ii) Execute Cycle : Consists of 2 types:
	Decode Cycle:In this phase the data stored in the registers is decoded based on the instruction OPCODE 
                value and the corresponding control signals are sent to move the data around or 
                perform specific tasks. The "binary data" is well read and converted into an assembly
                language for the execute phase.
	
	Execute Cycle: In this phase the ALU performs the tasks as specified by the assembly language for a 
                particular C/C++ program.

The steps to run the program are as follows:

i) Input the value of the index.

ii) Get the output as the answer. The fibonacci sequence starts like 1,1,2,3,5,8.... and so on.
